				<p class="line3 welcome3">Today, I pick up my pen and, as a friend,  extend to you a heartfelt invitation visit China: embark on a brand-new journey and experience the beauty of this ancient country that has stood for a thousand years.</p>
				<p class="line4 welcome4">Up to now, many foreign friends have already explored China, while others have set their sights on its wonders but have yet to take that first step.</p>
				<p class="line5 welcome5">What landscapes and experiences of China have you already learned about?</p>
				<p class="line6 welcome6">Is it Jinling (the ancient name of Nanjing), where the Qinhuai River carries old dreams on its boats through six dynasties of history? Or the golden splendor of Chang’an (the ancient name of Xi’an), a city adorned in royal grandeur,or the magnificent and splendid Chang 'an?</p>
				<p class="line7 welcome">Is it XinJiang, where camel bells echo and herding trails through vast grasslands? The snowy wonderland of the North——Harbin，where European-style fairytales come alive? Or the layered peaks and murmuring streams of Fenghuang Ancient Town?</p>
				<p class="line8 welcome8">Perhaps it’s the festive dragon dances and lion dances, the intricate craftsmanship of Shu brocade, the longing for rain-kissed Qinghua porcelain, the Head-pinned flowers, or the soothing melodies of Pingtan and the silk-thread art of Kunqu Opera?</p>
				<p class="line9 welcome9">
					This nation, steeped in millennia of history, and its people, who have thrived across the ages, still hold "hidden gems" of many great quality. They continue to live with sincerity, kindness, and diligence upon this profound land, and to embrace the world with open arms.</p>
				<p class="line10 welcome10">
					At this very moment, we write this letter to you, sincerely hoping you will visit China—not just once—to discover and experience it from many new perspectives. Through the journey, may the bridge between our cultures and hearts grow ever stronger and more convenient.</p>
				<p class="line11 welcome11">What does China look like during the unique festivities of Intangible Cultural Heritage Spring Festival? What efforts have we made to ensure smoother travels? And what extraordinary, yet undiscovered, wonders still await?</p>

				<p> The Chinese government has taken multiple measures to enhance the convenience of inbound tourism, which also gives in-depth "Chinese cultural Tours" more confidence to be chosen.</p>
				<p>First, China's visa-free entry policies is continuously being upgraded.</p>
				<p>Since January 2024, China has successively piloted unilateral visa-free policies for 38 countries including Switzerland, Australia, Portugal, Finland and South Korea.</p>
				<p>On December 17, 2024, the National Immigration Administration announced a new visa-free transit policy, extending the stay time of visa-free transit foreigners in China from the original 72 hours and 144 hours to 240 hours (10 days). 
					At the same time, the number of entry ports for visa-free transit personnel was increased to 60, and the area of stay and activity was expanded to 24 provinces.</p>
				<p>On March 8, 2025, Brunei officially implemented a visa-free entry policy for Chinese citizens, achieving mutual visa exemption between China and Brunei. As of now, China has achieved mutual visa-free access with 26 countries.</p>
				<!-- 新加入免签政策国家入境游数据 Googletrends -->
				<p>In addition, in February 2025, a visa-free policy was issued for ASEAN countries' tourist groups to enter Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province. The local customs and traditions of this city are also awaiting the arrival of foreign tourists.</p>
				<p>We have conducted a statistical analysis of the continents where 26 countries offer mutual visa-free access, 38 countries offer unilateral visa-free access, and 54 countries offer visa-free transit, as well as the straight-line distances from China.
					By combining these policies, it can be found that China encourages long-distance countries to enjoy more abundant time and broader territory for inbound tourism in China. This makes in-depth "cultural tourism" more suitable for selection under such conditions.</p>

				<p>We chose the global travel website TripAdvisor. In the "Attractions" section, we selected keywords related to culture such as "Historical Attractions", "Monuments", and "Historical museums", 
					screened the types of attractions, crawled the ratings, reviews and other data of attractions with more than 50 Chinese and foreign reviews, and conducted statistics on them.
					If you want to visit cultural attractions in China, the sharing and comments of these foreign tourists can offer you some references.</p>
				<p>Each circle in the map below represents a scenic spot. The larger the circle, the higher the popularity of the scenic spot. The popularity of a scenic spot is determined by the number of English reviews it has on TripAdvisor. 
				The more reviews there are, the higher the popularity. Hover to view the scenic spot ratings provided by TripAdvisor. Click to view the word cloud composed of TripAdvisor's scenic spot reviews. 
				Some scenic spots also include introductions to cultural experience projects obtained from the relevant sections within the scenic spots.</p>

				<p>Chinese civilization has a long history. </p>
				<p>The historical context of five thousand years，and it is our path of origin and also our future life. </p>
				<p>We hope that visitors from all directions can come to China to experience and enjoy it firsthand. 
				It's not just about traditional cuisine, but also about wearing beautiful hairpins, listening to gentle Pingtan, 
				and touching the bustling Shu brocade, bringing more of your dreams about Chinese aesthetics to life. </p>
				<p>We hope that the closely arranged modern cities and the moment when the Oriental Pearl Tower lights up at night will not be your entire impression of Chinese cities. 
				We also want to give you the small Bridges and flowing water, the Miao villages and Tulou, and the charm and fortune of the ancient capital of six dynasties.</p>
				<p>We hope that when you think of China, you will not only think of the four words "ancient country with a long history", 
				but also think of Han ink calligraphy, Confucius, Mencius, Confucianism and Taoism, the golden age of poetry, the long-desolate thatched cottage and the city of Chang 'an that never sleeps. </p>
				<p>Dear friends, we will always be here and always look forward to your arrival.</p>
